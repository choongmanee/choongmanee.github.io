Since my last post, a few noteworthy happenings came about. I switched jobs from Realogy (formerly known as ZapLabs) to Duetto, got my second AWS Certification, and heavily invested into learning Dart &amp;amp; Flutter to name a few.

This introduction is for me and all those who are new to blogging.
Good luck.</description></item></channel></rss>

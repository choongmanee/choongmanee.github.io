At this point, I've probably drafted and redrafted my first post more times than my hands and toes can count. Who knew that starting a blog could be both an exciting and uncomfortable experience? With that said, I'm looking forward to seeing what would become of this new endeavor. This introduction is for me and all those who are new to blogging.

Good luck.

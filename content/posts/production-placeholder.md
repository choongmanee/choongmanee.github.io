# Launch Day

Launch day had finally arrived. Countless hours of planning, designing, and engineering have lead to this climax and the
 team could not be more excited. All features have been verified ready and a release party was set to follow after as
  a reward to the team of its best efforts. All that was left was to simply deploy to production.

_...or so they thought_

What ensued was purely unfamiliar and deeply concerning. 

# Our pipeline failed

A moment of blank stares befell on the group only to be interrupted by a subtle sigh in the back. Engineers scrambled to
 poke and "prod" around to explore what failed while suppressing their obvious panic. Someone from the team Usain
  Bolts to go fetch that coveted devops hero as pressure mounts to release by `x` o'clock. `x + y` hours later, the
   team blows past the release deadline in record time and humbling fashion. 
   
The aftermath of the botched release was the cause of two critical API keys, a database connection, and a forgotten
 kill switch.
   
# So what REALLY went wrong?

It's easy to say that API keys or some other misconfiguration was the crux of the issue but to focus on that misses
 the bigger picture. A failed release such as this story was a product of deprioritizating __integrations__.

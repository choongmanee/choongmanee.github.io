### update
I've taken my focus away from blogging to dedicate my time and energy on other efforts. Since my last post, a few
noteworthy happenings came about. I switched jobs from [Realogy](https://www.realogy.com/) (formerly known as 
[ZapLabs](https://www.zaplabs.com/)) to [Duetto](https://www.duettocloud.com/), got my second 
[AWS Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/), and heavily invested into learning [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
 & [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to name a few. As exciting as each moment was, retaining and recalling everything 
 that I've learned has been challenging. Spending hours sifting once familiar material has felt stunting to making 
 progress on projects that I hope to see come about (more on that in a later post).

### purpose
> "The faintest ink is more powerful than the strongest memory"

I've had previous motives to start blogging such as having a digital brand and to practice writing, but none of these had 
a reward that was personally valuable. A pattern of inconveniences has brought me to purposing this blog as a record 
keeper of what I've learned for my own reference and to benefit those who come across it.
